Certainly, including information about the data source and a brief description in your README file is essential for transparency and understanding your energy consumption measurement project. Here's how you can add this section to your README:


# Data Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

## Data Description
The data used in this project is sourced from [Name of Data Source], which provides [briefly describe the source's purpose and data collection method, e.g., real-time energy consumption data from a network of smart meters in commercial buildings]. The data includes information on [list key data attributes, e.g., energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh), time stamps, and building identifiers].

## Data Access
Access to the data source can be obtained from [Include URL or contact information for data access]. Please refer to their terms of use and licensing agreements for any restrictions or requirements.

## Data Preprocessing
[Optional] If your project involves data preprocessing steps, provide details on how the raw data is prepared for analysis. This might include cleaning, filtering, or aggregating the data.


# Data Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

## Data Description
The data used in this project is sourced from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, which provides real-time energy consumption data for commercial buildings. The data includes information on energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh), water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions, along with building details and location information.

## Data Access
Access to the data source can be obtained through the [ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager API](https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/api-documentation), which offers a RESTful interface for retrieving energy data. Users will need to register for an API key and adhere to the terms of use and licensing agreements.

## Data Preprocessing
The raw data is preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers. Time series data is aggregated at daily intervals to facilitate analysis.
